The mod comes packaged with a few default icon packs:

- `stadium`, a slightly modified version of the character role icons used on the [LLB Stadium Discord](https://discord.gg/llbstadium) created by Lemon
- `klay`, a hand-drawn icon pack created by [klayfruit](https://klayfruit.straw.page/)

The mod also supports creating custom icon packs by placing subfolders in the Modding Folder, located by default at `<LLB install location>/ModdingFolder/CharacterStockIcons/packs-custom/`. Check the default packs in the repo at [`/packs-default/`](https://github.com/avgduck/CharacterStockIcons/tree/master/packs-default/) to reference formatting.
