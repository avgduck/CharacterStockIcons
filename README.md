The mod comes packaged with 1 default icon pack:

- `stadium`, a slightly modified version of the character role icons used on the [LLB Stadium Discord](https://discord.gg/llbstadium) created by Lemon

The mod also supports creating custom icon packs by placing subfolders in the Modding Folder, located by default at `<LLB install location>/ModdingFolder/CharacterStockIcons/packs-custom`.
